# custom-hacker-news

This project involved building a Python-based web scraper that targets the Hacker News website to filter and display the most popular news stories based on user votes. The primary objective was to automate the collection of high-value news articles with more than 100 votes, reducing manual effort and ensuring only relevant, impactful stories are shown.

Key features of this project include:

- Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup: Using Python's requests library to fetch HTML content from multiple pages of Hacker News and the BeautifulSoup library for parsing and extracting relevant data such as story titles, links, and vote counts.
- Data Filtering and Sorting: The scraper filters stories based on a threshold of 100+ votes and sorts them in descending order, ensuring that the most influential stories are presented first.
- Automation and Scalability: The script is designed to scrape multiple pages automatically, making it scalable for gathering a larger set of news stories from multiple pages with ease.
- Efficient Data Processing: Pythonâ€™s list comprehensions and sorting functions were used to create a streamlined, efficient process for handling and organizing the scraped data.

This project demonstrates my skills in web scraping, data parsing, and algorithmic sorting. It highlights my ability to work with real-time data from the web and produce meaningful outputs, an essential skill for any data-driven role in tech.
